# Hyperledger Grid

Hyperledger Grid is a platform for building supply chain solutions that include
distributed ledger components. It provides a growing set of tools that
accelerate development for supply chain smart contracts and client interfaces.

This project is not an implementation of a distributed ledger or a client
application. Instead, Hyperledger Grid provides supply-chain-focused libraries,
data models, and software development kits (SDKs) as modular, reusable
components.

The Hyperledger Grid project includes several repositories:

- [This repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid) contains core
  components such as supply-chain-centric data types and smart permissioning
  code.

- The [grid-contrib](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib) repository
  contains example domain models and reference implementations for smart
  contracts (also called "transaction families").

- The [grid-rfcs](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs) repository
  contains RFCs (requests for comments) for proposed and approved changes to
  Hyperledger Grid.


## Project Status

Hyperledger Grid is currently in the
[incubation](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Project+Lifecycle#ProjectLifecycle-incubation)
stage of the Hyperledger product lifecycle.
The [Hyperledger Grid
proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b6ES0bKUK30E2iZizy3vjVEhPn7IvsW5buDo7nFXBE0/)
was accepted in December, 2018.


## How to Participate

We welcome contributors, both organizations and individuals, to help shape
project direction, contribute ideas, provide use cases, and work on specific
